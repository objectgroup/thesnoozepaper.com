			<p>As a kid I thought soap operas were a long-running prank and that, one day, it would be revealed to this whole community of folk that their lives are being broadcast and their homes are packed with hidden cameras. I kept watching, anticipation building, then I cracked and asked my grandma if she knew when the prankster would come out and she was baffled. </p><p>Looking back it makes perfect sense why I would see soaps this way. The pranksters I saw on segments of breakfast TV had a child-like excitement about their very innocent, to the point of almost unnoticable, jokes. One prank from that time was clamping a police car, with the full agreement of the police, while hidden cameras filmed the public's reaction which was a raised eyebrow, a shrugged shoulder, somebody took a photo. But the host's love of mischief elevated this clip to a whole new level.</p> 
			<p>The innocence of the prank along with the enthusiasm of the prankster is still charming to me, so I couldn't help but dream up some bearly-there pranks and a character to administer them with a delight for mischief. </p>

			<p>I used to make mix tapes with a tape recorder off the radio. 
for a friends birthday I put together a collection of poems I thought she would like and she called it a poetry mixtape.
I like the idea of a summer mix tape but with words and poems and jokes
(BUT!) what if each 'track' contained a clue that leads you to the next 'track', these clues help navigate the order of the mixtape. 
So each 'track' could be labelled with a summer word and the joke or poem or just plain code or puzzle or activity would be the label the next 'track'. I could have these all be cut out from a page or they could be given loose or they could be on a page that has a path drawn between them.</p>
