			<p>A traditional children's comic for today. Having a trouble sleeping? Try reading this! One boy said of The Snooze Paper 'this is the new Beano' a girl said of the Snooze Paper 'I do have trouble sleeping so this is actually useful!' It makes a lovely gift for a child. Where does The Snooze Paper come from? It is a joke for my nephew, he didn't want to go to bed this one time, and I tried to convince him that sleep is lovely, you get to have a nice rest and be calm, but he was having none of it and wanted to stay up playing. I get what he means, it is hard to change pace like that. So The Snooze Paper started as something to help him get into a nice frame of mind from playing to sleeping. </p>

			<p>I used to make mix tapes with a tape recorder off the radio. 
for a friends birthday I put together a collection of poems I thought she would like and she called it a poetry mixtape.
I like the idea of a summer mix tape but with words and poems and jokes
(BUT!) what if each 'track' contained a clue that leads you to the next 'track', these clues help navigate the order of the mixtape. 
So each 'track' could be labelled with a summer word and the joke or poem or just plain code or puzzle or activity would be the label the next 'track'. I could have these all be cut out from a page or they could be given loose or they could be on a page that has a path drawn between them.</p>
